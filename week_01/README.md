## 📝 Designing Machine Learning Systems 

> 3 first chapters summary

In the book "[Designing Machine Learning Systems](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/designing-machine-learning/9781098107956/)," Chip Huyen, co-founder of Claypot AI, presents a holistic approach to designing and developing machine learning systems, highlighting the importance of designing data, choosing appropriate metrics, automating development processes, deployment, and model updating, as well as emphasizing the need for a robust monitoring system to quickly resolve production issues. The author also addresses the architecture of a flexible ML platform capable of serving various use cases and underscores the importance of developing responsible systems, incorporating ethical considerations such as fairness, transparency, and data security.

In the first chapter, "Overview of Machine Learning Systems," she begins by discussing when it is necessary to use machine learning, as it has proven to be a powerful tool for various applications, and presents five generic steps of what an ML model does: (1) learn (2) complex patterns from (3) existing data and use these patterns to make (4) predictions on (5) unseen data. She emphasizes that models tend to perform well on problems that are repetitive, scalable, where patterns constantly change, and the cost of a wrong prediction is low.

Next, she presents some use cases such as recommendation systems, fraud detection, among others, and underscores that the use of ML may not be appropriate in unethical situations, when simpler solutions are viable, or when it is not cost-effective. This chapter also highlighted the differences between ML in research and ML in production. Differences include stakeholder involvement, computational priority, properties of the data used, severity of fairness issues, and interpretability requirements.

In Chapter 2, "Introduction to Machine Learning Systems Design," the importance of aligning Machine Learning (ML) project objectives with business objectives is emphasized, highlighting relevant metrics for both areas, such as accuracy for data scientists and profit increase for companies. Essential requirements for ML systems are presented, including reliability, scalability, maintainability, and adaptability, crucial for project success. The process of framing ML problems is discussed, exploring task types such as classification and regression, and addressing the importance of objective functions to guide model learning. The text also examines the debate on the importance of data versus algorithmic intelligence and highlights current trends regarding the size of datasets used in ML models.

Chapter 3 explores the Fundamentals of Data Engineering, emphasizing understanding the sources and types of data in Machine Learning (ML) projects. The variety of data sources is discussed, including user input, system data, logs, internal databases, and third-party data, along with the challenges associated with their processing, storage, and retrieval. Implications of changes in data privacy, such as Apple's decision on IDFA, are examined, as well as strategies adopted by advertisers to address these restrictions.

The chapter also addresses different data formats and their characteristics for efficient storage and transmission, highlighting the importance of selecting the appropriate format based on the specific project needs. Relational and NoSQL data models are explored, as well as declarative ML systems, such as Ludwig and H2O AutoML, which simplify the process of building and training models.

Additionally, data flow methods between processes are discussed, such as passing through databases, services, and real-time transportation, highlighting their features, applications, and challenges. The text also emphasizes the applications of batch and stream data processing in the context of machine learning, emphasizing the importance of selecting the correct approach based on the nature of the data and system requirements.

In this regard, the book offers a comprehensive overview of the design and development of machine learning systems. From aligning business objectives to the fundamentals of data engineering, it highlights the importance of responsible and transparent systems, as well as discussing practical applications in the context of machine learning.
